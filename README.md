# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

"Benefits of Selecting the Right Trading Strategy - Selecting the right trading strategy may be one of the most important steps you’ll take.  Remember that the goal is to eventually master a certain strategy. So when you find something that shows promise and suits you, focus on it. Refine it.",

"Try different strategies. Look for the right fit. That’s generally a smart move … you don’t know what works until you try it.  The market changes.  No strategy works forever.  The market is constantly evolving and so should you.",

"Finding your stride - Different strategies work better in different environments. Trading breakouts can be advantageous when a lot of stocks are making breakouts … But when the market’s quiet, you may be better off trading for quick scalps and swing trades. Your trading success depends a lot on picking the right strategy for the right market environment.",

"Peace of mind. As traders, we all have different psychological makeup and risk tolerances. Some of us can’t sleep at night if we have an open position, so we might focus on day trading. Others might hate the frenzied pace of day trading. You might feel perfectly calm holding positions for weeks. Trading shouldn’t mean dying of stress. You should enjoy your life — pick a strategy that fits your mindset.",

"Lifestyle. Different lifestyles mean different strategies. Day trading can mean sitting in front of the screen all day … not great for a 9-to-5er. Longer-term trading often means you won’t be in front of the screens as much. It’s generally much more accessible if you work a full-time job. When you’re picking your strategy, keep your preferred lifestyle in mind."
