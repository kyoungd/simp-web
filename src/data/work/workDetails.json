Trading breakouts can be advantageous when a lot of stocks are making breakouts … But when the market’s quiet, you may be better off trading for quick scalps and swing trades. Your trading success depends a lot on picking the right strategy for the right market environment.",
                "Peace of mind. As traders, we all have different psychological makeup and risk tolerances. Some of us can’t sleep at night if we have an open position, so we might focus on day trading. Others might hate the frenzied pace of day trading. You might feel perfectly calm holding positions for weeks. Trading shouldn’t mean dying of stress. You should enjoy your life — pick a strategy that fits your mindset.",
                "Lifestyle. Different lifestyles mean different strategies. Day trading can mean sitting in front of the screen all day … not great for a 9-to-5er. Longer-term trading often means you won’t be in front of the screens as much. It’s generally much more accessible if you work a full-time job. When you’re picking your strategy, keep your preferred lifestyle in mind."
