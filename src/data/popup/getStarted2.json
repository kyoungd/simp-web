This can make it difficult for them to make informed trading decisions.</p>",

Trading can be a complex and risky endeavor, and individual traders may not have the benefit of experienced mentors or colleagues to turn to for advice. This can increase the chances of making costly mistakes, especially for inexperienced traders.</p>",
